C-Projects
==========

I did some projects in C. Matrix multiplication, Generating a simulation engin and its applicatoin and implementing diskstra algorithm.

Note that each folder contains a pdf file, which describes the problem in hand. 
These problems are among the homework assignments we did in the computational problem solving class at Georgia tech.
